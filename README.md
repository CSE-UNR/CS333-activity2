# Class Activity 2

Tic-Tac-Toe Exercise
## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to:
1. Allow students to practice using the Python programming language
2. Allow students to explore incorporating Unit Tests

## Program
Implement a simplified object-oriented tic-tac-toe game to be played via a command-line interface.

### Part 1 Requirements 
The board is a grid of 3-by-3 squares, all initially unclaimed. Each move will fill a square with an X or an O.
The game is over when 3 in a row of either X or O in any direction is found.
Please complete the implementation of the Board class and its methods, through which the game will be played.  

*NOTE*  You are welcome to implement any additional methods and/or data structures outside of the board that you feel are needed or helpful to complete the game.

### Part 2 Requirements
Provide at least 4 unit tests for the your classes and methods.
