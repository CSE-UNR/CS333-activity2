# Class Activity 2
Unit Tests... "sort" of!

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to:
1. Allow students to practice using the Python programming language
2. Allow students to explore incorporating Unit Tests

## Program
Create one class which stores a collection of items and provides functionality for 3 different sorting algorithms to be applied to the collection.

## Testing
Create a class for your unit test suite. Include as many tests as you think are necessary to determine your code works properly.

## Requirements
1. .py files for the sorting class and test class
2. A text document with you and your partner's reflections on what you think is hard about unit testing. Consider places where you aren’t testing the "smallest unit" or where there is code you can’t test.
